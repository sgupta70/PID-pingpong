# PID-pingpong
## Description 
For this project we were assigned to design, build, and program a device that uses PID feedback control. We decided that we would use PID to keep a ping-pong ball floating in a steady position. We are using a motor which works as a fan that will increase or decrease3 its speed depending on the distance from a sensor to keep it in one place.

## Plan/Schedule 
Week #1 (17-21): start code, get the sensor code working/start CAD                                                                                                       
Week #2 (24-28): figure out how to get the fan working/ continue working on CAD                                                                                           
Week #3 (1-5): continue code and CAD hopefully CAD is pretty much done                                                                                                   
Week #4 (8-12): hopefully print and start to assemble, make sure code is working                                                                                         
Week #5 (15-19): polish and clean up make sure everything is working well
